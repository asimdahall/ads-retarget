 1) Item-set, frequency etc. is automatically displayed in terminal. Also,
 2) Goto localhost:7777 in browser to manually enter items to get item-set, frequency, confidence, support of items..
 
It is because I've use two apriori algo in project:
   One is apriori.js in root folder.
   Another is in dist/apriori.js
See example.js and package.json for details..
Used express.js server.
